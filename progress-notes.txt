## 2026-01-26 10:07 - Task 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.6

**Status**: pending → done
**Validation**: npm run check passes (0 errors), npm run web:check passes (svelte-check 0 errors), npm test passes (736 tests, 11 API tests cover endpoints), dev server starts successfully
**Commit**: edfdfd1
**Notes**: Implemented dashboard panels with real data per specs/web-ui.md.

**Updated Dashboard (`src/web/app/src/routes/+page.svelte`):**

- Replaced all placeholder data with real API calls using `onMount`
- `Promise.all` parallel loading for:
  - `api.getStats()` → Quick stats (total nodes, tokens, cost)
  - `api.getAggregatedToolErrors()` → Tool failures by model
  - `api.listNodes()` → Recent activity timeline
  - `api.getDaemonStatus()` → Daemon/queue status
- Implemented error handling with retry-friendly message (resolved `no-ex-assign` lint issue by using separate `errorMessage` state)
- Added visual indicators for trends (improving/worsening/stable)
- Formatted metrics (percentages, currency, relative time)

**API Enhancements:**

- **Daemon Status (`src/api/routes/daemon.ts`)**:
  - Enhanced `/api/v1/daemon/status` to include queue stats (pending, running, failed)
  - Added worker stats placeholder (implicitly derived from queue state)
- **Tool Errors (`src/api/routes/tool-errors.ts`)**:
  - Updated `/api/v1/tool-errors/aggregated` to support `groupByModel=true`
  - Allows grouping by `tool, errorType` OR `model, tool, errorType`
- **Node Repository (`src/storage/node-repository.ts`)**:
  - Updated `getAggregatedToolErrors` to support optional model grouping
  - Fixed `any` type usage with proper TypeScript interface

**API Client (`src/web/app/src/lib/api/client.ts`):**

- Added `getToolErrorStats`
- Updated `getAggregatedToolErrors` signature
- Updated `getDaemonStatus` return type

**Validation:**

- Verified data flow from SQLite → Repository → API → Frontend
- Checked error states (when daemon offline)
- Verified loading states
- Verified formatting of dates and numbers

## 2026-01-26 17:48 - Task 9.5

**Status**: pending → done
**Validation**:
- Added getComputerFromPath() helper in src/config/config.ts
- For spoke sessions, returns the spoke name from config
- For local sessions (hub), returns os.hostname()
- Uses proper path boundary checking (e.g., /synced/laptop doesn't match /synced/laptop-backup)
- Updated worker to use getComputerFromPath() instead of hardcoded os.hostname()
- Added 7 unit tests for getComputerFromPath() covering:
  - Local sessions → hostname
  - Spoke sessions → spoke name
  - Multiple spokes
  - Disabled spokes
  - Trailing slashes
  - Path boundary checking
  - Empty spokes
- Fixed watcher isFromSpoke() path boundary checking (uncommitted from 9.4)

- The computer field now correctly identifies which machine a session came from
- For local hub sessions: uses the hostname (e.g., "desktop")
- For synced spoke sessions: uses the spoke name from config (e.g., "laptop", "server")
- This enables filtering and grouping nodes by source computer in the UI
- Phase 9 (Multi-Computer Sync) is now complete
