# Code Review Fix Progress

Branch: fix/code-review-20260128-064546
Created: 2026-01-28 06:46
Main branch: major/pi-brain

## Issues to Fix

1. [P2] src/api/routes/query.ts:106-128 - Embedding provider created on every request
   The embedding provider is created fresh on every query request. If createEmbeddingProvider
   performs any initialization (HTTP client setup, connection pooling, etc.), this creates
   unnecessary overhead. Consider creating the provider once at server startup or caching it.

2. [P3] src/daemon/query-processor.ts:217-219 - Destructuring assumes single element array
   The code destructures the first element from the embedding result without checking if the
   array is empty or the result is malformed. If embed() returns an empty array, queryEmbedding
   would be undefined, causing confusing errors downstream.

3. [P3] src/daemon/query-processor.ts:222-225 - Redundant filter transformation
   The filters are already in the correct shape but are being transformed redundantly.
   The transformation is harmless but adds unnecessary indirection.
