# Code Review Fix Progress

Branch: fix/code-review-20260127-105321
Created: 2026-01-27 10:53
Main branch: major/pi-brain

## Issues to Fix

1. P1: `decodeProjectDir()` in analyzer.ts naively replaces all `-` with `/`
   - Corrupts paths like `pi-brain` → `pi/brain`
   - Need to check pi's actual encoding scheme

2. P2: `extractSegments()` in boundary.ts never populates boundaries field
   - Segments created with `boundaries: []` 
   - Loses semantic context about why segments were split

3. P2: `boundaryByEntryId` Map can overwrite boundaries
   - If two boundary types occur at same entry, only last is kept
   - Should use Map<string, Boundary[]> instead
